Greetings, new colleagues and possible new friends. My name is Cat, and I made my account before I knew usernames were made public. It should be something more professional, but I'm stuck with @catnipthyme. Such is life.

I had a Bad Time at a coding bootcamp, and the Negative Events that followed destroyed my wish to continue learning. It is time, however, to get back at it. I aim to study/code every day. I aim for consistency -- even thirty minutes of coding is better than not coding at all. Baby steps are still steps. The massive quantity of tutorials and courses and tips all across the internet bogged me down for some time, delaying my re-entry into the field, but in February of 2025 I decided to focus on The Odin Project as my main resource. I started from scratch. 

I would be happy to pair-program with fellow JavaScript learners of any level to complete little projects and help each other on our coding journeys.

Feel free to contact me at catcerickson@gmail.com.
